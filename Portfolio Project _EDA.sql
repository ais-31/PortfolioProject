-- Exploratory Data Analyst

-- Here we are jsut going to explore the data and find trends or patterns or anything interesting like outliers

-- normally when you start the EDA process you have some idea of what you're looking for

-- with this info we are just going to look around and see what we find!

-- Which companies had 1 which is basically 100 percent of they company laid off
SELECT *

WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1;
-- these are mostly startups it looks like who all went out of business during this time










-- SOMEWHAT TOUGHER AND MOSTLY USING GROUP BY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Companies with the biggest single Layoff
